# Models

- `ml/` – Scikit-learn models (Level 3)
- `dl/` – Deep learning models (Level 4)
- `portfolio/` – Optimization & RL (Level 6)
- `artifacts/` – Saved models/checkpoints (create when needed)

TODOs:
- Level 3: Baselines (Naive, Linear), RF/XGBoost
- Level 4: LSTM/GRU seq models, normalization pipeline
- Level 6: CVXPY optimizer, RL environment and agents
